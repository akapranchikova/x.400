# Roadmap & Status

The roadmap mirrors the standalone `ROADMAP.md` file and adds more context for stakeholders.

## Release phases

| Phase | Goals | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MVP | Mock transport, SQLite store, CLI skeleton, UI shell | ✅ Delivered |
| Parity | SDK integration, FWM/FWZ import, automated reports | 🚧 In progress |
| Extensions | Real-time notifications, advanced tracing, policy engine | ⏳ Planned |

## Detailed milestones

### MVP

- ✅ Monorepo scaffold with pnpm + Turbo
- ✅ Mock Rust service with HTTP IPC
- ✅ React + Tauri UI showing folders, messages, and compose dialog
- ✅ CLI reproducing key FW_SI verbs
- ✅ MkDocs documentation portal

### Parity

- 🚧 Integrate vendor X.400 SDK via FFI
- 🚧 Complete SQLCipher hardening with keychain integration
- 🚧 Deliver migration tooling for FWM/FWZ archives
- 🚧 Expand Vitest and cargo test coverage

### Extensions

- ⏳ Streaming push channel for live folder updates
- ⏳ Policy-driven submit strategies (DLP, escalation flows)
- ⏳ SIEM integrations and trace bundle uploads

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vendor SDK licensing | High | Engage legal and procurement early; mock transport keeps engineers unblocked |
| SQLCipher performance overhead | Medium | Benchmark with representative archives, tune page size, and prepare read replicas |
| Code signing complexity | Medium | Provide platform-specific guides and automation scripts |

The roadmap is reviewed at the start of each sprint. Contributions should align with the current phase and include updates to this document.
